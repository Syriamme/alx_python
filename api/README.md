# Employee Data API Project

## Background Context

In traditional system administration, Bash scripting was the go-to tool for various tasks. While Bash is suitable for many purposes, it can become messy and inefficient when handling complex tasks. The new generation of system administrators, often referred to as SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), possess a broader skill set, including proficiency in programming languages. In this project, we'll explore the transition from Bash to Python scripting and tackle the task of accessing and organizing employee data using Python scripts.

One prevalent approach for exposing applications and datasets is to utilize APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs serve as the public interface of websites and microservices, enabling external users to interact with and manipulate data. In this project, we will access employee data via an API and organize and export it into various data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

### General
1. What is an API?
2. What is a REST API?
3. What are microservices?
4. What is the CSV format?
5. What is the JSON format?
6. Pythonic Package and module naming conventions.
7. Pythonic Class naming conventions.
8. Pythonic Variable naming conventions.
9. Pythonic Function naming conventions.
10. Pythonic Constant naming conventions.
11. The significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python.

## Requirements

### General

#### Editors
- Recommended editors: Visual Studio Code

#### Environment
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3).

#### Coding Standards
- All your files should end with a new line.
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
- Your code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guidelines.

#### Documentation
- You must include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- All your modules should have documentation (you can generate it using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- You must use `get` to access dictionary values by key (it won't throw an exception if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary).
- Your code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
